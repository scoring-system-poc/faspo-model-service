# FASPO model-service

This repository contains source code for the FASPO model-service. The model-service is a microservice 
that is responsible for running the FASPO model, i.e. calculating scoring for given subject.

NOTE: all currently implemented calculations are completely made up and from bussiness point of view
pretty much nonsensical
